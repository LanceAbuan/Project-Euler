# Project-Euler
I solve Project Euler problems for fun and practice occasionally. Good brain excercies.
Rather than using the power of Python3 to find answers easily, (for example, flipping a number by using str(num) == str(num)[::-1] instead of using modulo etc)
I prefer to approach problems with a mathematical mindset. Logic practice.
